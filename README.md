Ok, this is a WIP, I'll tell when a first version is testable. 

Notes for the future : 

- git clone the project.
- Configurate your DB in config.yml
- bin/console database:create
- bin/console do:sc:up --force 
- use the attached SQL dump in order to populate the tables
- yarn encore dev --watch 
- login
